# FunctaFormer: Domain-Agnostic Super-Resolution
Super-resolution techniques have made remarkable progress in recent years, especially in the vision domain. However, extending these advances to other data modalities has been challenging due to the need for specialized architectures tailored to each domain. In this work, we introduce FunctaFormer, a novel domain-agnostic super-resolution method capable of upscaling any arbitrary data type. Our approach leverages Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) to model data as continuous functions, providing a unified framework across different modalities. FunctaFormer obtains competitive performance across various domains, including images, audio, videos, 3D shapes, manifold data, and LiDAR scans.

using INRs, FunctaFormer can upsample any data modality (shown here as 2D images, 1D audio waveforms, 3D shapes, polar coordinates
for manifold data, 2+1D videos, and LiDAR point clouds).

## Overview
FunctaFormer is a novel super-resolution method that works across multiple data modalities, including:

üñºÔ∏è Images  
üéµ Audio  
üßä 3D Shapes  
üåç Manifold Data  
üé• Videos  
üì° LiDAR Scans  

Unlike traditional super-resolution methods that require domain-specific architectures, FunctaFormer leverages Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) to model data as continuous functions. This enables unified and scalable super-resolution across diverse data types.

## Features
‚úÖ Domain-agnostic: Works on various data types without modification.  
‚úÖ INR-based: Uses continuous function representations for better generalization.  
‚úÖ Performance: Competitive results across multiple domains.  
‚úÖ Flexible & Scalable: Can be extended to new data types easily.
